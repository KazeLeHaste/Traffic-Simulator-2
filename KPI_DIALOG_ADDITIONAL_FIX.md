# KPI Benchmark Results Dialog Fix - Additional Updates

This update addresses issues with duplicate or empty KPI Benchmark results dialogs that appeared after implementing the fullscreen view.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Empty Dialog Instances**: Fixed by completely removing the original dialog-based implementation in favor of a pure fullscreen approach
   - Removed instances of `dialog benchmark-dialog` elements that were causing the empty templates
   - Eliminated the legacy dialog implementation that was conflicting with the new fullscreen approach

2. **Multiple Dialog Instances**: Resolved by implementing proper cleanup for all dialog types
   - Added cleanup for both legacy dialogs and new fullscreen modals
   - Added removal of containers before creating new ones
   - Implemented event listener for proper cleanup when closing

3. **Consistent Implementation**: Updated both SimulationPageComponent and AnalyticsPageComponent
   - Both components now use the same approach for displaying KPI results
   - Consistent use of the fullscreen implementation across the application
   - Better handling of component lifecycle and cleanup

## Implementation Details

1. **SimulationPageComponent Changes**:
   - Completely replaced the old dialog-based implementation
   - Now creates a dedicated container for fullscreen visualization
   - Added proper event listeners for cleanup on close

2. **AnalyticsPageComponent Changes**:
   - Updated to match the SimulationPageComponent approach
   - Removed the legacy dialog approach
   - Implemented consistent fullscreen visualization

3. **KPIVisualizationComponent Improvements**:
   - Enhanced cleanup of existing dialogs and modals
   - Improved chart destruction to prevent memory leaks
   - Better event dispatching for parent component notification

These updates ensure a consistent and clean user experience when viewing KPI Benchmark results in fullscreen mode without duplicate or empty dialogs appearing.
