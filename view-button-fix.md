# View Button Fix in Analytics Page

## Issue Description

When clicking the "View" button in the Analytics page, users should see the detailed KPI Benchmark Results displayed in the same format as shown after running a KPI Benchmark test, but this functionality was not working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was related to the implementation of the `viewEntryDetails` method in the AnalyticsPageComponent. While the method was correctly converting the analytics entry to a BenchmarkRun format and creating a KPIVisualizationComponent, there were several potential issues:

1. Insufficient error handling and logging
2. No verification that the visualization container was properly created
3. Potential issues with cleaning up previous visualization components

## Changes Made

1. Added comprehensive error handling and debugging logs
2. Added verification steps to ensure the visualization container exists
3. Added a try/catch block around the visualization component creation and display
4. Fixed the visualization container reference to use a consistent ID
5. Added cleanup for the visualization container when the dialog is closed
6. Improved the flow of the method to ensure proper sequence of operations

## Testing Steps

1. Run the Traffic Simulator application
2. Add at least one benchmark result to the Analytics page
3. Navigate to the Analytics page
4. Click on the "View" button for one of the entries
5. Verify that a dialog opens with the detailed KPI Benchmark results
6. Verify that all charts, tables, and metrics are correctly displayed
7. Verify that the "Add to Analytics" button is hidden (since we're already in Analytics)
8. Close the dialog and verify it cleans up properly
9. Open Developer Tools and check the console for any errors

## Expected Results

When clicking the "View" button in the Analytics page, users should see a dialog with the complete KPI Benchmark Results, including:

1. Summary metrics
2. Time-series charts
3. Detailed tables of all metrics
4. Exactly the same visualization as seen after running a benchmark test

## Additional Improvements

1. Added debug logging throughout the viewEntryDetails method
2. Created a more reliable reference to the visualization container
3. Added explicit error handling for all key operations
4. Improved cleanup when closing the dialog

This fix ensures users can properly view and analyze the detailed benchmark results from the Analytics page, completing the Analytics feature implementation.
