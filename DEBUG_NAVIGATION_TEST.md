# Home Page Navigation Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidance for testing the home page navigation functionality after the recent fixes.

## What Was Fixed
- Navigation buttons on the home page were not responding to clicks
- Home page content wasn't scrollable, hiding content below the fold
- Recent layouts buttons had inconsistent behavior

## Testing Steps

### 1. Home Page Button Navigation
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Verify you can see the home page with the "Start Building" and "View Simulation" buttons
3. Click the "Start Building" button
4. Verify you are redirected to the builder page
5. Navigate back to the home page using the navigation bar
6. Click the "View Simulation" button
7. Verify you are redirected to the simulation page

### 2. Home Page Scrolling
1. Navigate to the home page
2. Verify you can see the "Recent Layouts" section
3. Try scrolling down with your mouse wheel or trackpad
4. Verify you can see the "How to Use" and "Key Features" sections
5. Verify you can scroll all the way to the bottom of the page

### 3. Recent Layouts Functionality
1. Create at least one layout in the builder and save it
2. Navigate back to the home page
3. Verify that your saved layout appears in the "Recent Layouts" section
4. Click the "Edit" button on a layout card
5. Verify you are redirected to the builder with that layout loaded
6. Navigate back to the home page
7. Click the "Simulate" button on a layout card
8. Verify you are redirected to the simulation page with that layout loaded

## Console Debugging
If issues persist, open your browser's developer console (F12) and look for:
- Navigation logs (prefixed with "Router attempting to navigate to:")
- Button click logs (look for "Builder button clicked" or "Simulation button clicked")
- Layout button logs (look for "Layout button clicked!")

## Fixed Files
- `src/pages/HomePage.ts` - Enhanced event listeners and styling
- `src/core/Router.ts` - Improved navigation logging and error handling
- `src/app.ts` - Added body classes for page-specific scrolling behavior
- `css/style.css` - Fixed overflow and positioning conflicts

## Notes
- If any buttons still don't work, try refreshing the page with a hard reload (Ctrl+F5)
- The navigation buttons now have increased z-index to ensure they're clickable
- Event listeners are now attached with a slight delay to ensure DOM is fully ready
