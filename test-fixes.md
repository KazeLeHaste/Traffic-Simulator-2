# Testing Canvas Interaction and ControlSignals Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Canvas ID Conflicts Fixed
- **Builder Page**: Now uses `<canvas id="builder-canvas">` instead of `<canvas id="canvas">`
- **Simulation Page**: Now uses `<canvas id="simulation-canvas">` instead of `<canvas id="canvas">`
- **Visualizer Constructor**: Updated to accept `canvasId` parameter and dynamically bind to the correct canvas
- **CSS**: Updated to handle both `#builder-canvas` and `#simulation-canvas` selectors

### 2. ControlSignals Method Loss Fixed
- **ControlSignals.copy()**: Fixed the prototype chain issue where `onTick` method was being lost during serialization/deserialization
- **Object.setPrototypeOf()**: Added to ensure copied objects maintain proper prototype chain

### 3. Event Listener and Resource Cleanup
- **Builder destroy()**: Now properly removes `builder-canvas` element on navigation
- **Simulation destroy()**: Now properly removes `simulation-canvas` element on navigation
- **Visualizer destroy()**: Enhanced to properly clean up event listeners and animation loops

## Expected Results

### Canvas Interaction
- ✅ Builder page canvas should be fully interactive (grid highlighting, intersection placement, road creation)
- ✅ Simulation page canvas should be fully interactive (zooming, panning, simulation controls)
- ✅ Navigation between pages should not cause canvas freezing or duplication
- ✅ Each page should have its own independent canvas instance

### ControlSignals Error
- ✅ No more "intersection.controlSignals.onTick is not a function" errors
- ✅ Layout loading should work without runtime errors
- ✅ Simulation reset should work without errors
- ✅ Traffic lights should function properly in simulation mode

### Performance
- ✅ No memory leaks from lingering event listeners
- ✅ Smooth transitions between pages
- ✅ Proper cleanup when destroying page components

## Test Cases

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Builder Page Canvas**:
   - Navigate to Builder page
   - Verify grid is visible and interactive
   - Test Shift+Click to create intersections
   - Test Shift+Drag to create roads
   - Test mouse wheel zoom functionality
   - Test mouse drag for panning

2. **Test Navigation Between Pages**:
   - Navigate from Builder to Simulation
   - Navigate from Simulation to Builder
   - Navigate to Home and back
   - Verify no canvas duplication or freezing

3. **Test Layout Loading**:
   - Create a layout in Builder with intersections and roads
   - Save the layout
   - Load the layout in Builder (should work without errors)
   - Load the layout in Simulation (should work without errors)

4. **Test Simulation Controls**:
   - Load a layout with intersections in Simulation
   - Start simulation (should not produce controlSignals errors)
   - Reset simulation (should not produce controlSignals errors)
   - Verify traffic lights are working

## Implementation Notes

### Canvas ID Strategy
- Each page component creates its own unique canvas element
- Visualizer constructor accepts canvasId parameter for flexibility
- CSS uses unified selectors to style both canvas types

### ControlSignals Fix Strategy
- Ensured proper prototype chain restoration in copy() method
- Added proper method binding to maintain `this` context
- Used `Object.setPrototypeOf()` for reliable prototype restoration

### Resource Management
- Proper canvas element removal in destroy() methods
- Enhanced visualizer cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Event listener cleanup to prevent conflicts
