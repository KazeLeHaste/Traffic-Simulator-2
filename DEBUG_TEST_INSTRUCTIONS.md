## Canvas Freezing Debug Test Instructions

The application now includes extensive debug logging to help identify the source of the canvas freezing issue. Here's how to test:

### Setup:
1. The server is running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12) to view logs
3. Look for debug messages with prefixes like:
   - 🔗 [Builder Event logs]
   - 🌍 [World state changes]
   - 🎨 [Visualizer drawing]
   - 🔧 [Tool binding]
   - 🏊 [Pool operations]

### Test Cases:

#### Test 1: Clear Button (Builder Page)
1. Navigate to the Builder page
2. Use Shift+Click to create intersections and Shift+Drag to create roads between them
3. Observe the logs - you should see successful generation
4. Click the "🗑️ Clear" button
5. **Watch the console** - look for any errors or where the logging stops
6. Check if the canvas becomes unresponsive

#### Test 2: Load Layout (Builder Page)
1. If you have saved layouts, click "📁 Load Layout" and select one
2. **Watch the console** - look for the 🔄 DEBUG messages
3. Check if the canvas freezes during or after loading

#### Test 3: Load Layout (Simulation Page)
1. Navigate to the Simulation page
2. Click "📁 Load Layout" and select a layout
3. **Watch the console** - look for the 🔄 [SIM DEBUG] messages
4. Check if the canvas turns black or freezes

### What to Look For:
- **Error messages** in the console
- **Where the logging stops** (indicates where the freeze occurs)
- **Tool binding messages** (🔧) - these might indicate interference
- **Visualizer drawing messages** (🎨) - these show if drawing is failing
- **World state changes** (🌍) - these show if world operations are hanging

### Key Debug Patterns:
- If you see logs stop after "Calling world.clear()" or "Calling world.load()", the issue is in world operations
- If you see logs stop after "Calling forceRefresh()", the issue is in visualization
- If you see "Tool binding" messages repeating rapidly, there might be a tool binding loop
- If you see drawing errors for intersections/roads, there might be invalid data

### Expected Behavior:
- Each operation should complete with a "completed successfully" message
- The canvas should remain responsive
- No errors should appear in the console

Please run these tests and share the console output, especially noting where the logging stops or any error messages that appear.
