# Compare Runs Button Removal - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation removes the "Compare Runs" button from the KPI Benchmark results page as requested. The "Compare Runs" functionality was replaced by the more comprehensive Analytics feature, making this button redundant.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Button and Event Listener
- Removed the "Compare Runs" button from the KPI visualization component HTML template
- Removed the event listener for the "compare-runs-btn" element

### 2. Preserved Related Code
- Left the `showComparisonPanel` and `showComparison` methods in place, as they might be referenced elsewhere in the codebase
- The comparison panel in the HTML template was also preserved for the same reason

### 3. Verification
- Verified that the "Compare Runs" button no longer appears in the HTML template
- Confirmed that the build process completes successfully

## Impact

- Users will no longer see the "Compare Runs" button on the KPI Benchmark results page
- Simplified the interface by removing redundant functionality
- The Analytics feature now serves as the central hub for comparing benchmark results

## Notes

The Analytics feature provides a more comprehensive solution for comparing benchmark runs with the following benefits:
- Session-persistent storage for multiple benchmark runs
- Multi-selection capability for comparing more than two runs
- More detailed comparison metrics and visualizations
