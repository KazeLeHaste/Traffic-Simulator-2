## Canvas Freezing Debug Implementation Summary

I've added comprehensive debug logging throughout the application to help identify the source of canvas freezing issues. Here's what has been implemented:

### Debug Logging Added:

#### 1. World State Operations (`src/model/world.ts`)
- **clear()**: Logs world state before/after clearing
- **set()**: Logs pool creation and object counts
- **load()**: Detailed logging of layout loading process
- These will help identify if the world state operations are hanging

#### 2. Pool Operations (`src/model/pool.ts`)
- **constructor()**: Logs pool creation and object loading
- Will show if pool initialization is causing delays

#### 3. Visualizer Operations (`src/visualizer/visualizer.ts`)
- **draw()**: Extensive logging of the main draw loop
- **drawSingleFrame()**: Logs single frame rendering
- **forceRefresh()**: Logs forced refresh operations
- **ensureToolsAreBound()**: Logs tool binding operations
- **drawIntersection()**: Logs individual intersection drawing
- **drawRoad()**: Logs individual road drawing
- These will show exactly where in the rendering pipeline the freeze occurs

#### 4. Graphics Operations (`src/visualizer/graphics.ts`)
- **clear()**: Logs canvas clearing operations
- Will show if low-level canvas operations are failing

#### 5. Page Component Operations
- **BuilderPageComponent**: Logs clear, load, and generate operations
- **SimulationPageComponent**: Logs layout loading
- These will show if page-level operations are causing issues

#### 6. New Test Features
- Added tools to create and edit road layouts
- Comprehensive error handling with stack traces

### Debug Log Prefixes:
- 🔗 **Builder Event logs** - User interactions in builder
- 🌍 **World state changes** - World operations (clear, load, set)
- 🎨 **Visualizer drawing** - All rendering operations
- 🔧 **Tool binding** - Interactive tool management
- 🏊 **Pool operations** - Object pool management
- 🔄 **Layout operations** - Loading/saving layouts

### How to Use:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12) when testing
2. **Look for error messages** or where logging suddenly stops
3. **Test the problem scenarios**:
   - Click "🗑️ Clear" in builder (watch for 🧹 logs)
   - Click "📁 Load Layout" (watch for 🔄 logs)
   - Use Shift+Click to create intersections and Shift+Drag to create roads

### What the Logs Will Reveal:

**If freezing occurs during world operations:**
- Logs will stop after "Calling world.clear()" or "Calling world.load()"
- Look for pool creation issues or world state problems

**If freezing occurs during visualization:**
- Logs will stop after "Calling forceRefresh()" or during draw operations
- Look for graphics errors or intersection/road drawing failures

**If freezing occurs due to tool binding:**
- Look for rapid repetition of 🔧 tool binding messages
- Check for tool binding loops or errors

### Next Steps:
Run the application (`http://localhost:8080`), open the browser console, and test the problematic operations. The debug logs will pinpoint exactly where the freezing occurs, allowing for a targeted fix.
