# Vehicle Emojis Implementation

This document details the implementation of vehicle emojis in the Road Traffic Simulator.

## Overview

The implementation adds visual enhancements to the traffic simulation by:

1. Displaying vehicle emojis instead of plain colored boxes
2. Adding traffic control emojis at intersection centers
3. Disabling debug information by default for a cleaner visual experience

## Vehicle Emoji Implementation

Vehicles now display appropriate emojis based on their dimensions and characteristics:

- 🚗 Car: Default vehicle emoji for standard-sized vehicles
- 🚙 SUV: Used for medium-sized vehicles (length > 3.8)
- 🚚 Truck: Used for longer vehicles (length > 4.5)
- 🚌 Bus: Used for wider vehicles (length > 3.5 and width > 2.0)
- 🏍️ Motorcycle: Used for smaller vehicles (length < 3.2 and width < 1.6)
- 🚕 Taxi: Used for vehicles with a yellow color hue

The emoji is centered within the vehicle rectangle and sized proportionally to the vehicle dimensions.

## Traffic Control Emoji Implementation

Each intersection now displays an emoji indicating its traffic control strategy:

- 🚦 Fixed timing traffic light: Default traffic control strategy
- 🚥 Adaptive timing traffic light: For intersections using adaptive timing
- 👮 Traffic enforcer: For intersections with a traffic enforcer strategy

The traffic control emoji is displayed at the center of each intersection and sized proportionally to the intersection dimensions (50% of the intersection's smallest dimension).

## Debug Mode Changes

Debug information (vehicle IDs, intersection IDs, traffic light timing details) is now completely disabled to provide a cleaner visual experience. All debug visualizations have been removed from the rendering code, including:

- Vehicle IDs and labels
- Vehicle trajectory path previews
- Intersection IDs and labels
- Traffic light timing details

This ensures a clean, distraction-free visualization focused solely on the vehicle emojis and traffic control indicators.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation modifies two key methods in the `Visualizer` class:

1. `drawCar()`: Enhanced to display vehicle emojis based on car attributes
2. `drawIntersection()`: Enhanced to display traffic control emojis based on the active strategy

The modifications ensure that the original functionality is preserved while adding these visual enhancements.

## Performance Considerations

- The emoji rendering uses standard canvas text drawing operations
- Emojis scale proportionally with zoom level
- The implementation maintains compatibility with existing traffic control strategies
