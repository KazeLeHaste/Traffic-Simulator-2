# Road Traffic Simulator - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Road Traffic Simulator is an advanced web-based simulation tool for modeling and analyzing traffic flow, with a focus on intersection management and traffic control strategies. This document summarizes the key features, implementation details, and testing approach for the project.

## Key Features

### 1. KPI Benchmarking System
- Real-time collection of comprehensive traffic metrics
- Interactive visualization with charts and tables
- Export functionality (CSV and JSON)
- Historical comparison of benchmark runs
- Validation system for data accuracy

### 2. Modular Traffic Control Strategies
- Strategy pattern implementation for interchangeable control algorithms
- Multiple implemented strategies:
  - Fixed Timing Strategy
  - Adaptive Timing Strategy
  - Traffic Enforcer Strategy
- Real-time strategy switching during simulation
- Configurable parameters for each strategy

### 3. Scenario Management
- Save and load complete traffic scenarios
- Import/export functionality for scenario sharing
- Preset library of test scenarios
- Persistent storage across browser sessions

### 4. Results Export & Visualization
- Interactive time-series charts
- Sortable, searchable data tables
- Summary cards for key metrics
- Side-by-side benchmark comparison
- CSV and JSON export with validation

### 5. Enhanced User Interface
- Dark theme with consistent design
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Intuitive controls for simulation management
- Real-time feedback and updates
- Professional data visualization

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture
- Component-based design with clear separation of concerns
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Strategy pattern for traffic control algorithms
- Observer pattern for event-based updates
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Singleton pattern for global services

### Key Technologies
- TypeScript for robust, type-safe code
- Chart.js for interactive data visualization
- WebGL for efficient rendering
- Webpack for module bundling
- Jest for testing
- CSS for responsive styling

### Code Structure
- `src/model/`: Domain objects and business logic
- `src/visualizer/`: Rendering and visualization components
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `src/pages/`: Main application pages
- `src/lib/`: Utilities and services
- `src/tests/`: Test cases and test framework
- `css/`: Styling and themes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component-level tests for core functionality
- Mocking of dependencies for isolated testing
- Test cases for edge conditions and error handling

### Integration Testing
- Testing interactions between components
- Verification of data flow through the system
- Testing strategy switching and scenario management

### UI Testing
- Verification of UI components and interactions
- Responsive design testing
- Browser compatibility testing

### Performance Testing
- Testing with large road networks
- Testing with high vehicle counts
- Testing long-running simulations
