# KPI Benchmark Results Dialog Fix

This implementation addresses an issue with the KPI Benchmark results dialog where multiple instances could appear or an empty template would display after closing the dialog.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Multiple Dialog Instances**: Fixed by ensuring any existing fullscreen modals are removed before creating a new one
   - Added cleanup in the render method to remove existing modals
   - Improved the closeFullscreen method to better handle cleanup

2. **Empty Template After Closing**: Resolved by properly cleaning up resources and preventing template artifacts
   - Improved chart destruction to prevent memory leaks
   - Fixed HTML structure that had improper nesting

3. **Modal Stacking Issues**: Fixed by improving z-index and ensuring proper modal layering
   - Increased z-index to 1500 to ensure the KPI dialog appears above all other UI elements
   - Improved overflow handling to prevent scrolling issues

## Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced Cleanup Process**:
   - Chart instances are now properly destroyed before creating new ones
   - DOM elements are properly cleaned up when closing the dialog

2. **Improved Modal Structure**:
   - Fixed HTML structure to ensure proper nesting and closing of div elements
   - Removed redundant container elements that could cause rendering issues

3. **Event Handling**:
   - Added custom event dispatching when the dialog is closed to notify parent components
   - Improved the close button functionality to properly clean up resources

This implementation ensures a more robust KPI Benchmark results dialog that properly handles fullscreen display and cleanup.
