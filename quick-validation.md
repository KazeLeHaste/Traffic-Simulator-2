# Quick KPI Validation Guide

## Steps to Test the Enhanced KPI System

### 1. Basic Functionality Test âœ…
- [x] Open the application at http://localhost:8080
- [x] Navigate to Simulation page
- [ ] Load a simple layout or create one
- [ ] Run a KPI benchmark with default settings
- [ ] Verify the benchmark results dialog opens with charts and tables
- [ ] Test CSV export functionality
- [ ] Test JSON export functionality
- [ ] Run validation to check export accuracy

### 2. UI Components Test
- [ ] Verify charts display correctly (speed, throughput, wait time, congestion)
- [ ] Test table sorting functionality
- [ ] Test table search functionality
- [ ] Check summary cards display accurate data
- [ ] Verify responsive design works properly

### 3. Export Validation Test
- [ ] Export CSV and check file format
- [ ] Export JSON and verify structure
- [ ] Run validation and confirm all checks pass
- [ ] Compare exported data with UI display manually

### 4. Comparison Feature Test
- [ ] Run multiple benchmarks with different settings
- [ ] Use comparison feature to analyze differences
- [ ] Verify percentage calculations are correct
- [ ] Test historical data persistence

### 5. Error Handling Test
- [x] Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- [x] Fixed Chart.js module import issue (updated chart.d.ts)
- [ ] Test with various traffic control strategies
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of edge cases

## Quick Access to Test Features

### In the Simulation Page:
1. **Start Benchmark**: Click "ðŸ“Š Run KPI Benchmark"
2. **View Results**: Automatic dialog opens after benchmark completion
3. **Export Data**: Use "ðŸ“„ Export CSV" and "ðŸ“‹ Export JSON" buttons
4. **Validate**: Click "âœ“ Validate Data" to verify export accuracy
5. **Compare**: Use "ðŸ“Š Compare Runs" for historical comparison

### Expected Behavior:
- All charts should render without errors
- Tables should be interactive and responsive
- Export files should download automatically
- Validation should report all checks passed
- No console errors should appear

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE
All major features have been implemented and integrated:
- Interactive KPI visualization with Chart.js
- Comprehensive export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Built-in validation system
- Benchmark comparison features
- Professional UI design with dark theme consistency
