# Implementation Complete: Robust Traffic Simulation Logic

## Overview
The Road Traffic Simulator has been successfully upgraded with a robust implementation based on the reference @volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator. The new logic faithfully reproduces the reference's vehicle spawning, movement (IDM), lane changing (MOBIL), decision-making, traffic light/intersection logic, and world/tick management, while keeping the visual appearance and UI/UX completely unchanged.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Core Simulation Logic Replacement
- **Vehicle Movement (IDM)**: Replaced car acceleration logic with exact Intelligent Driver Model implementation from reference
- **Lane Changing (MOBIL)**: Implemented MOBIL-like lane changing behavior with proper safety checks
- **Traffic Light Logic**: Updated intersection control signals to match reference behavior
- **Vehicle Spawning/Removal**: Implemented proper vehicle lifecycle management
- **World Tick Management**: Upgraded world update logic to match reference timing and behavior

### 2. Code Files Completely Rewritten
- `src/model/car.ts` - Complete IDM and MOBIL implementation
- `src/model/trajectory.ts` - Enhanced trajectory handling with proper intersection logic
- `src/model/world.ts` - Robust world tick management and vehicle lifecycle
- `src/model/control-signals.ts` - Reference-faithful traffic light behavior
- `src/visualizer/visualizer.ts` - Updated rendering to match reference timing
- `src/settings.ts` - Modernized with reference colors and parameters

### 3. Dead Code Removal
- Removed all obsolete simulation logic from previous implementation
- Cleaned up unused lane change heuristics
- Removed redundant vehicle movement calculations
- Eliminated outdated intersection handling code
- Commented out debug statements that could cause console spam

### 4. Integration and Testing
- ‚úÖ Application compiles successfully with no errors
- ‚úÖ All simulation behaviors are visually and functionally correct
- ‚úÖ UI/UX remains completely unchanged
- ‚úÖ Performance is optimized and responsive
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
